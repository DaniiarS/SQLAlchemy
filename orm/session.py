# NOTE: The fundamental transactional / database interactive object when using the ORM is called the Session. 
#       In modern SQLAlchemy, this object is used in a manner very similar to that of the Connection, and in fact 
#       as the Session is used, it refers to a Connection internally which it uses to emit SQL.

# NOTE: The Session doesnâ€™t actually hold onto the Connection object after it ends the transaction. 
#       It gets a new Connection from the Engine the next time it needs to execute SQL against the database.
